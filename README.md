- Most recently completed major project: [Scholar++](https://scholarplusplus.org/) is a web application designed to act as a search engine for research data using the OpenAlex API. The main goal of the application is to allow users to tailor their searches to their needs with a variety of filters, enabling searches to be as broad or narrow as necessary. Built in Python with the Django web framework, Scholar++ can be accessed from any device with a web browser, including mobile devices. This site was developed in a team of 10 as a professional software engineering endeavour. The repository for it is private.
- Current major project in development: A mobile app leveraging Google's Gemini AI to assist dyslexic children with their textbook studies. It is coded in Flutter so the final product will be able to run on Android devices. As of now, the repository is set to private.
